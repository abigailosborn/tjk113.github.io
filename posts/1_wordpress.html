            <p>Many people use WordPress to run their personal websites. Its web interface seems to offer enough features to satisfy most needs a user could have. But maybe it's too much...</p>
            
            <h2>How I Know</h2>
            <p>I implemented <a href="https://github.com/tjk113/tjk113.github.io">my own blog engine</a> in <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a>! Simply hosting something like this on GitHub Pages is all you need for an adequate personal blog. You don’t even have to write an HTML/CSS/Markdown parser yourself if you don’t want to. There are many packages that do so for you! In fact, there are packages that implement the entire blog engine for you! You just have to do a little boilerplate and you’re up and running! And, of course, you could always just use the web interface of not just WordPress, but any of many companies that offer similar services. But we’re programmers! Reinventing the wheel isn’t a bad thing. It not only serves as an educational experience, but also to give us some perspective on the software that has come before. That perspective can be invaluable when developing the software that is yet to come.</p>
            
            <h2>Does it matter?</h2>
            <p>In a word where a lot of new software is being written exclusively for the web, and popular frameworks depend on hundreds if not thousands of packages just to get started, there is a lot to be said for simplicity. As programming languages become more complex, and programmers become further removed from the hardware underneath, we lose something: the mastery of our tools. A developer who can write the glue code to string together five or ten huge frameworks probably doesn’t think about cache lines. And fair enough, these two things exist in different domains of knowledge. But ignorance of what happens underneath doesn’t shield us against its consequences.</p>
