            <p>I got into programming because of Super Mario 64. Specifically, the tool-assisted speedrunning (TAS) community surrounding the game. By 2020, I had been involved in the RTA speedrunning community for a couple years, and had become interested in TASing. Around this time, the first public releases of the Super Mario 64 Decompilation Project were coming out, and libsm64, a dynamic library implementing the game, had been released (closed-source, as part of Wafel). Rust and Python bindings were created for the library, and being used to create *tools* to *assist* TASers in *speedrunning* :). I wanted to learn how to use them too, so one night I binged all of a Microsoft beginner Python playlist on YouTube. I think that Python was a great first language for me. I had barely programmed anything before (leaving aside a brief attempt to make a Minecraft mod when I was a kid...), but by the next morning I was up and running with VSCode and a Python interpreter. The fact that anybody hadn't started with this kind of setup would be somewhat of a surprise to me later...  </p>
            <p>Over the next year, I began going to college in-person (my first year had been online because of the pandemic). During this time, I would occasionally create small scripts that did little more than take some user input and print some strings. One of my roommates at the time was a Computer Science major, and sometimes I would discuss programming with her. The CS program at my school was Java-based, though, so my Python twiddling wasn't really something that she could relate to. By this time, I knew how much bigger programming was than the small slice that I had figured out, and I had become infinitely fascinated by the magic-like systems that underpinned such a huge portion of modern life. The more I learned about CS, the more I realized I didn't know. Sometimes left me feeling demotivated, tohugh. The idea of leaping into a huge world of complexity trying to hide inside the machines I'd been using my whole life was a bit... daunting, to say the least. So I just continued to learn more manageable things whenever I felt like it or had a need for it, like regex, or list comprehensions.  </p>
            <p>One of the steps I took towards understanding *computers* was learning C++. I don't remember now exactly why I chose C++, but I imagine that I just thought the syntax looked neat, and that it was supposed to be a "lower level" language. Here's an image I made during the first month of learning, which shows my early thoughts about the language:</p>

            <p><figcaption>Despite my incredulity, I don't think I knew just how much worse the verbosity could get.</figcaption></figure></p>
            <p>At the time, I hadn't planned on taking any of the CS courses offered by my college, and wanted to continue learning on my own (I was already doing a Psychology degree). As the next year rolled around, however, I found myself at a loss for what courses to take, and so I found myself in those very CS courses. Though my distaste for Java was strong (I hadn't liked what I'd seen of my old roommate's assignments), I just figured I'd breeze through the classes without absorbing any new information. Through learning Java, though, I (perhaps predictably) gained a much better understanding of what object-oriented programming actually meant. I also enrolled in a Computer Architecture course, which turned out to be more focused on cloud architecture than hardware than I'd hoped. I still hold a strong bias against Amazon Web Services... Anyway, pleasantly surprised to have ended up learning new things in my courses, I declared a minor in CS in my junior year. The majority of my programming, however, was still being done for things outside of class...  </p>
            <p>Around this time was when I started trying to learn Rust. This is where I learned the very fine art of utilizing systems you don't understand. This is also where I learned the consequences of such an approach. For someone who understood as much about memory management as I did about the neuroscience lectures I wasn't paying attention to, I had no chance at understanding what a "lifetime" was. This is emblematic of a wall I constantly felt I was running into. My knowledge seemed stuck, and understanding the big complexities of computer science felt, at best, many years away (if I even stuck with it). During this time, I had become acquainted with Lua, as it was the scripting language utilized by the mupen64-rr emulator for automation (which TASers still heavily use, in spite of Wafel's development). These projects were more practically useful than anything I'd written before, and I took some pride in that.  </p>
